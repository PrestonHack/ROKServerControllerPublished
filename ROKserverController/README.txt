When you first run a server there will be no config files just select the ROK.exe for the server path,
and start the server in order to create the config files. Ignore the warning that tells you to select the config path. 
After server has started the configuration folder for the server will be in the ROK Server controller folder under configuration. 
Then point the config path at the serversettings.cfg file in this folder.
